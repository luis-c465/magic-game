# Magic game

A game for the terra hackathon in the coding club

## Idea

Endless game where the player fights off increasingly harder tanks on preset levels blocks with random tank amounts. After defeating all the tanks in that wave the player can upgrade his wand and move to the next wave in a different map.

## Player

A tank with various magic wands that can be switched between with the number keys
